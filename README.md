# Music Recommendation App

## Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset

Lyrics-based content recommender with a lightweight Streamlit UI.

This project demonstrates a production-minded, content-based music recommender that uses song lyrics, TF‑IDF vectorization, and approximate nearest neighbours (cosine similarity) to find similar tracks. It includes a Jupyter notebook for exploration and standalone scripts for preprocessing and serving recommendations.

**Key features:**
- Clean and deterministic lyrics preprocessing
- TF‑IDF vectorization with configurable feature limits
- Fast similarity search via `NearestNeighbors` (cosine)
- Interactive Streamlit UI to explore recommendations
- Minimal, reproducible preprocessing pipeline with pickle persistence

**Repository Structure**

- `music_recommendation_app.ipynb` — Notebook demonstrating the end-to-end pipeline (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, demo).
- `data/spotify_millsongdata.csv` — Source dataset (not included due to size / licensing).
- `src/preprocess.py` — Script to clean text and build TF‑IDF matrix, saves artifacts to `pkl/`.
- `src/recommendation.py` — Loads artifacts and exposes `recommend_songs()` used by the Streamlit app.
- `src/app.py` — Minimal Streamlit UI to select a song and show recommendations.
- `pkl/` — Directory where preprocessed DataFrame and TF‑IDF matrix are stored (generated by `preprocess.py`).
- `requirements.txt` — Python package requirements.

Quickstart
----------

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # on Windows (Git Bash / WSL: use `source .venv/bin/activate`)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place the dataset CSV at `data/spotify_millsongdata.csv`.

Preprocess (build TF‑IDF and save artifacts)
-------------------------------------------

Run the preprocessing script to clean lyrics and build TF‑IDF features. This creates `pkl/df_cleaned.pkl` and `pkl/tfidf_matrix.pkl` used by the recommendation engine.

```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

Notes:
- The script will download required NLTK resources (`punkt`, `stopwords`) if missing.
- For quick demo runs, the script downsamples the dataset to ~10k rows by default.

Run the Streamlit app
---------------------

Start the interactive UI after preprocessing finishes:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Then open the provided localhost URL in a browser to select a song and get recommendations.

Use the Notebook
----------------

`music_recommendation_app.ipynb` contains a documented, commented pipeline you can run interactively. It shows data loading, EDA (word cloud), preprocessing functions, building TF‑IDF, fitting `NearestNeighbors`, and a simple recommendation demo.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- File not found: ensure `data/spotify_millsongdata.csv` exists in the `data/` folder.
- NLTK downloads failing: check network access or manually download *punkt* and *stopwords* via NLTK.
- Memory issues: reduce sample size or lower `max_features` in TF‑IDF to reduce memory footprint.

Demo of the Code

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome. Suggested improvements:

- Add fuzzy title matching for more robust seed selection.
- Persist and load a fitted `NearestNeighbors` model to avoid refitting at startup.
- Add unit tests for preprocessing and recommendation logic.
